This worksheet focuses on getting remote sensing data and its I/O in R.

After completing this worksheet, you should have a structured working environment and be able to read and write raster geo-data in R.

## Things you need for this worksheet
  * [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} — the interpreter can be installed on any operation system.
  * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} — we recommend to use R Studio for (interactive) programming with R.

## Remote sensing data I/O
Please create the working environment for this course following the mandatory settings provided by the [info on assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/unit01/unit01-04_notes_on_assignments#mandatory-working-environment).

Please write an R markdown script with html output which describes how to read and very basically visualize the provided data set in R

Save your Rmd file and knitr it. Make sure that the html file is created 

The R package [*raster*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html){:target="_blank"} is a good starting point for raster data I/O.
